# wp-plugin-skeleton
A Wordpress plugin skeleton designed for agile development

This is a Wordpress Plugin Development helper, a skeleton that helps you create plugins easier and faster, designed for cases where a custom post type is just either too big. 

No documentation is provided at this point, as this is mostly used for internal development.

We would be very happy if you'd give it a spin tough.
